Reveil-en	2	real	1	2	Octopus	1	15	"Inky the Octopus Escapes from Aquarium@#@An octopus has made a brazen escape from the National Aquarium in New Zealand by breaking out of its tank, slithering down a 50-meter drainpipe and disappearing into the sea. In scenes reminiscent of Finding Nemo, Inky – a common New Zealand octopus – made his dash for freedom after the lid of his tank was accidentally left slightly ajar."		NA	NA	NA	NA	NA
Reveil-en	2	real	1	2	Octopus	2	16	"Staff believe that in the middle of the night, while the aquarium was deserted, Inky clambered to the top of his glass enclosure, down the side of the tank and traveled across the floor of the aquarium."		NA	NA	NA	NA	NA
Reveil-en	2	real	1	2	Octopus	3	17	"Rob Yarrell, national manager of the National Aquarium of New Zealand in Napier, said: “Octopuses are famous escape artists. I don’t think he was unhappy with us, or lonely, as octopuses are solitary creatures. But, he is such a curious boy. He would want to know what’s happening on the outside. That’s just his personality.”"	1	How does Yarrell describe Inky’s personality?	Curious	Nervous about what’s happening on the outside	Unhappy	Playful and mischievous
Reveil-en	2	real	1	2	Octopus	4	18	"One theory is that Inky slid across the aquarium floor – a journey of three or four meters – and then, sensing freedom was at hand, into a drainpipe that led directly to the sea. The drainpipe was 50 meters long and opened onto the waters of Hawke’s Bay, on the east coast of New Zealand’s North Island."		NA	NA	NA	NA	NA

Reveil-en	2	real	1	2	Octopus	6	20	"“When we came in the next morning and his tank was empty, I was really surprised,” said Yarrell, who has not launched a search for Inky. “The staff and I have been pretty sad. But then, this is Inky and he’s always been a bit of a surprise octopus.”"	2	How did Inky escape?	No one is sure - there are several theories that could explain his escape	Through an open pipe at the top of his tank	Yarrell and other staff secretly helped him	Through a window that was accidentally left open
Reveil-en	2	real	1	2	Octopus	7	21	"Reiss Jenkinson, exhibits keeper at the National Aquarium, said he was absolutely certain Inky had not been taken. “I understand the nature of octopus behavior very well,” he said. “I have seen octopuses on boats slip through bilge pumps. And, the security here is too tight for anyone to take Inky and why would they?”"		NA	NA	NA	NA	NA
Reveil-en	2	real	1	2	Octopus	8	22	"Because octopuses have no bones, they are able to fit into extremely small spaces and have been filmed squeezing through gaps the size of coins. They are also understood to be extremely intelligent and capable of using tools."		NA	NA	NA	NA	NA
Reveil-en	2	real	1	2	Octopus	9	23	"At the Island Bay Marine Education Center in Wellington, an octopus was found to be in the habit of visiting another tank overnight to steal crabs, then returning to its own.

Reveil-en	2	real	1	2	Octopus	10	24	"Inky was brought to the National Aquarium a number of years ago by a local fisherman who found him caught in a crayfish pot.

Reveil-en	2	real	1	2	Octopus	11	25	"According to Yarrell, Inky – who is about the size of a rugby ball – was an “unusually intelligent” octopus. “He was very friendly, very inquisitive and a popular attraction here. We have another octopus, Blotchy, but he is smaller than Inky and Inky had the personality.”"		NA	NA	NA	NA	NA
Reveil-en	2	real	1	2	Octopus	12	26	"The aquarium has no plans to step up security as a result of the escape as Inky was a “one-off” but the staff are “increasingly aware of what octopuses can actually do”. Although the aquarium is not actively searching for a replacement for Inky, if a fisherman brought in another octopus, it might be willing to take it on."	4	Why was Inky in poor shape before coming to the aquarium?	Because he fought with fish on a reef	Because he lived around sick fish	Because he lived in a dirty fishing pot	Because he was mistreated in the previous aquarium he lived in

They highly respect them	They think they are too committed to their companies	They criticize their willingness to sacrifice family for work	They think they are too complacent
Reveil-en	2	real	1	3	Japan	9	35	"More employees are falling ill from stress, or worse, succumbing to karoshi, death through overwork.
